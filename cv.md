## Hobbies & Interests
Turns out that programming is tons of fun and of course it doesn't end with Swift and native iOS - that's why I am also extremely proficient in web programming, starting with Berkeley sockets and ending with Vue/Vuex/vue-router stack with writing a webserver in go with `gin` or node with `express`/`koa`/`nest` in between. I once wanted to do operating systems, well this date is postponed.
