## Hobbies & Interests
I am teased by the general idea of doing system programming, low level graphics and hardware drivers, and thus I am really invested into rather dated literature about the inner workings of POSIX systems, and I would like to get to the point of thorough understanding of the kernel structure and how stuff... works, basically. I am also into swimming, wallclimbing and languages.
