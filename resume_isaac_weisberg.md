*iOS Developer April 2019 - Present*

Native iOS/UIKit development in a one year old "rich client" project.  

Clean architecture with coordinator-tree-based navigation and RxSwift based MVVM.

Heavy isolated chunks of functionality  
Incredible emphasis on the UX  
Regular feature based code-review  
Schedule independent refactoring  
gRPC based server interoperation  
CoreData based waste of time and patience  
Establishing architectural conventions in coop  
A/B experiments and analytics grind  
Developer intreviews

Pushed 4 sizable chunks of functionality into production, outputting high-quality low-maintainance-cost code.

### **Magora Systems, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation**  
*iOS Developer October 2018 - April 2019*

Native iOS with Swift in an outsourcing company.

Clean architecture with coordinator-tree-based navigation and RxSwift based MVVM (*note how I copy-pasted it from the section above*).  

Participated in a 2k+ hours project.

Interviewed 15+ candidates for upper and lower tier iOS developers positions.  
Pre-sale and limited scope estimation.  
Presented a modernization and unification of project-wise error handling and propagation.  
Participated in productivity optimization of networking API design standards.  
Introduced the team to RxDataSources and RxKeyboard, which lead to a general codebase improval.

Native frontend development:
- Windows Presentation Foundation, commercial practice
- Unity Engine, commercial practice
- Androind Platform, understanding of concepts, no notable practice

Other:
- Kotlin, knowing the language by docs, no notable practice
- C, practice projects: implementation of OOP, closures, macro-based generic type system, usage of aio and standard library

## Interesting commercial problem solving cases

*Magora Systems, Winter 2019*: the client application boasted zero native funcionality yet was sold as 2 separate native clients anyway. One of the requirements was to have a video player with customized playback widgets. The catch was that it was necessary that all the content was hosted at Youtube. I've been in charge of building a web view coated with native widgets, scrollable playback progress bar, timestamps, navigation. Interopped with Javascript that exposed the Youtube player API, have writter Reactive wrappers for events coming in a out of the web view's Javascript context.

Nothing could save the player though: the UX was terrible, Youtube embedded player would totally break on screen rotation, the players own widgets rendered in web view just wouldn't go away without reliance on DOM's structure and manual removal, also Youtube strictly prohibits custom overlays and widgets threatening with a ban. Fun times. Client was flattered.

## Hobbies & Interests

Bikeriding was one of my biggest passions until I discovered electric scooters. Also I am totally into autosport, currently studying at a driving school and hoping one day I won't procrastinate just enough to enter a karting league as an amateur driver.

## Notable activity

GitHub open source projects  
Medium articles in FRP and architecture  
Functional and reactive state systems research  
Public speech and technical writing  
Education strategies and human resource crisis
