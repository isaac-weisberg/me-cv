Currently I am employed by the iDSi Apps, a subdivision of DANKOLAB, in Cademy viscinity, city of Novosibirsk. The team's major direction is development of end-user entertainment iOS applcations, in creation of which I am playing the role of the lead iOS programmer.

The skills that I have acquired in the process of working with the company for more than a year already allow my projects to be modular, state-transient, responsive per asynchronisity systems with complex, multi-layered back-ends, with the majority of attention going towards not only the reliablity and solidity of codebase, but also maintainablity, because that's what you need to do with your apps sometimes-- maintain and expand upon. I do not do Apple's MVC (which stands for Massive View Controller) pattern, I initialize the states of my apps asynchrounously, I create UIViewController's in a uniform way, I use more than one Storyboard and more than one Strings file for the localization.

My biggest desire in my career is to be involved in work with teams of passionate professionals who are just that - they live systems, they dream experience (user experience, that is) - rather than associal scrubs whose participation in projects is spineless, zero-involvement "I need to pay my bills" kind of vibe. This is not a goal though. It's an environment in which I feel myself most comfortable and productive. What otherwise is a shortterm goal is to assist in spawning a project in which I am not forced to be isolated from the audience, something that has been an elephant in the room while writing iOS apps in the aforementioned company. Also I have a long term goal, but that's a secret.

I am confident in my experience, I am open to learning and I expect the experience anywhere but here to be different in ways the development is approached, and thus, I am ready to adapt. I would like to showcase my skills and knowledge in any form you would find suitable. I look forward to discussing my qualifications further.
