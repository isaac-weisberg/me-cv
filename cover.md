Currently I am employed by the iDSi Apps, in Cademy viscinity, city of Novosibirsk. The team's major direction is development of end-user entertainment iOS applcations, in creation of which I am playing the role of the lead iOS programmer.

The skills that I have acquired in the process of working with the company for more than a year already allow my projects to be modular, state-transient, responsive systems with complex, multi-layered back-ends, with the majority of attention going towards not only the reliablity and solidity of codebase, but also maintainablity, because that's what you need to do with your apps sometimes-- maintain them, and modify. I do not do Apple's MVC (which stands for Massive View Controller) pattern, I initialize the states of my apps asynchrounously, I create UIViewController's in a uniform way, I use more than one storyboard in projects and more than one Strings file for the localization. I understand why reactive programming is the future of the software architecture and why uniform code-styling and algorithmic problems approach methodologies are beneficial for projects' maintenance.

My biggest desire in my career is to be involved in work with teams of passionate professionals who are just that - they live systems, they dream experience (user experience, that is) - rather than associal scrubs whose participation in projects is spineless, zero-involvement "I need to pay my bills" kind of vibe. This is not a goal, rather an environment in which I feel myself most comfortable and productive. What, otherwise, is a short-term goal is to assist in spawning a project in which I am not forced to be isolated from the target audience and the development life cycles per release, some project I would have to responsibly maintain and tune, rework and learn from. In my opinion, this would work for me as a tremendous showcase of the quality of my architectural solutions. Also I have a long-term goal, but that's a secret :) .

I am confident in my experience, I am open to learning and I expect the experience anywhere but here to be different in ways the development is approached, and thus, I am ready to adapt. I would like to showcase my skills and knowledge in any form you would find suitable. I look forward to discussing my qualifications.
